# TEAM.NO.49:AI Based Multi-Class Ensemble Learning System for Cervical Cancer Detection

## About

This project focuses on detecting cervical cancer using a deep learning ensemble architecture. The system classifies cervical cytology images into:

1.Normal

2.Precancerous

3.Malignant


The solution integrates EfficientNetB0 and MobileNetV2 (fine-tuned), combined using soft probability voting, achieving a final accuracy of 95%.
A Flask-based web app enables users to upload images and receive predictions, along with a downloadable medical-style PDF report.

## System Architecture

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e383925-7662-4de2-a561-c26713d4da8c)

📌 Ensemble Formula:
final_probabilities = (EfficientNetB0_output + MobileNetV2_output) / 2

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing

i) The images from the Mendeley Cervical Cytology Dataset were cleaned by removing corrupted or unreadable files.

ii) All images were resized to 224 × 224 px, normalized, and converted into a consistent RGB format suitable for CNN processing.

iii) Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, brightness shift, and horizontal flip were applied to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

### 2. Model Training

i) Two deep learning models were used for feature extraction and classification:

1.EfficientNetB0 (Pretrained on ImageNet)

2.Fine-Tuned MobileNetV2

ii) The outputs of both models were combined using a soft probability voting ensemble technique, forming a final deployable model named:
ensemble_model.keras

iii) The model was trained in Google Colab using GPU acceleration with Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss, and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

### 3. Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics included: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

The ensemble model demonstrated improved performance across all classes compared to individual models.

The final deployed model achieved:

# IMAGE SIZE & CLASS LABELS
img_size = (224, 224)
class_labels = ["Normal", "Precancerous", "Malignant"]

# MODEL 1: EfficientNetB0
base1 = EfficientNetB0(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
x1 = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base1.output)
x1 = Dropout(0.4)(x1)
out1 = Dense(3, activation="softmax")(x1)
eff_model = Model(inputs=base1.input, outputs=out1)

# MODEL 2: Fine-Tuned MobileNetV2
base2 = MobileNetV2(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
x2 = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base2.output)
x2 = Dropout(0.4)(x2)
out2 = Dense(3, activation="softmax")(x2)
mobile_model = Model(inputs=base2.input, outputs=out2)

# Load trained models
eff_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("efficientnet_model.h5")
mobile_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("mobilenet_finetuned.h5")

# ENSEMBLE LAYER (Soft Voting)
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
eff_output = eff_model(input_layer)
mob_output = mobile_model(input_layer)

ensemble_output = tf.keras.layers.Average()([eff_output, mob_output])
ensemble_model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=ensemble_output)

# Save Final Model
ensemble_model.save("ensemble_model.keras")
print("Final Ensemble Model Saved Successfully")

# IMAGE PREPROCESSING & PREDICTION
def preprocess_image(path):
    img = image.load_img(path, target_size=img_size)
    img = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
    return np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

def predict_image(img_path):
    img = preprocess_image(img_path)
    eff_pred = eff_model.predict(img)
    mob_pred = mobile_model.predict(img)
    final_prob = (eff_pred + mob_pred) / 2
    pred_class = np.argmax(final_prob)
    print("\nPredicted Class:", class_labels[pred_class])
    print("Confidence Score:", round(float(np.max(final_prob)) * 100, 2), "%")
```

## Results
The final ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 95%, providing strong performance in classifying cervical cytology images across all three classes (Normal, Precancerous, Malignant).

This system enables early-stage detection, which may support medical professionals and improve preventive healthcare outcomes.
